<!-- A header for the page
A section which will have links to about.html and whichever other pages you choose to create
A personal or placeholder image
A few paragraphs worth of personal or placeholder text
A list of likes
A list of dislikes
Open your about.html file and add the following sections:

A header for the page
A section which will have links to index.html and whichever other pages you choose to create
A couple of clearly seperated text entries for your "about page"
When you finish this part of the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo and create a GitHub Pages site using the repository. Remember:

git add .
git commit -m "<COMMENT>"
git push origin master
Instructions: Part III

Add another page called gallery.html where you can store samples of your work
Link this page to your index.html page.
Think about any other pages you would ideally like to have.
Bonus: Create a sitemap that lists the pages you will publish and identifies how they are connected.
What do you want these pages to look like? If needed, spend some time researching possible references for inspiration (e.g. identify some specific sites with pages and design layouts that you like. Bookmark these - you will want to reference them again later!
Based on your ideas and your design references, think about how you would like to navigate between sections and pages on your site. Create a few sketches outlining the ideal page layout for your site - these are called wireframes.
These sketches don't have to be fancy - you don't need special drawing tools. You can use a simple mobile app, an online tool like Google Draw, or even pen and paper! The point is simply to visualize your ideas.
When making your wireframes, keep in mind page layout as well as element positioning, sizing, and shape.
Finally, save your work! You'll want to return to this site later this week and throughout the program, as we learn how to style our sites and add content. -->
